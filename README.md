### Find the graph of this black box:
At first. We donâ€™t know what our black box contains. The first thing we have to do is put a value in an input file and run the black box file to get output. But that method seems like slowly because we only can put one value and run the black box file one at a time.  


As the following problem. We write a [shell script](https://github.com/Rayato159/G6-Optimization-Exam/tree/main/script%20%26%26%20execute_file) (.sh file) to solve that problem. The shell script will input a value, run the black box function to get output, and write output values into the new output files autonomously.
